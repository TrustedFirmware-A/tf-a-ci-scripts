The scripts in this folder are a copy of the scripts in the projectscratch
folder. They should be kept in sync, deploy_scratch.sh is a helper script
to copy them over.
The integrity of the files in the projectscratch folder is checked by the
check_scratch.sh script called by the tf-merge-watcher job. Please do not
create any additional files or modify existing ones in the projectscratch
directory without having these changes in the git repository.
