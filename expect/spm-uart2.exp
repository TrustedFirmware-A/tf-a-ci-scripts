# UART2 captures prints from SP0. If we exit from here, expect script will stop
# capturing the output from telnet process spawned for tracking uart2 console.
# Hence, we need to hold the uart such that the expect script captures the
# outputs to uart log. We do this by configuring timeout to never expire and
# expecting an unexpected string such as "FOOBAR". Refer uart-hold.inc
