Hello @{user_name}!


Thank you for your contribution to **Trusted Firmware-A**!

The TF-A project has now migrated to www.trustedfirmware.org. Our GitHub repo will remain accessible as a Read-Only mirror but we have changed the way we accept contributions for the project.

## How do I contribute patches to TF-A?
We have a [Getting started](https://developer.trustedfirmware.org/w/tf_a/gerrit-getting-started/) article which we hope will make everything very straightforward!

## What if I face any problems?
We have many channels through which you can contact us:

 * **Our mailing lists**
