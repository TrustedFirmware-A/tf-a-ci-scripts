Hello @{user_name}!


Thank you for raising an issue for **Trusted Firmware-A**.

The TF-A project has now migrated to www.trustedfirmware.org. This issue tracker will still remain accessible for some time, but only for historical reasons. From now on you should raise new issues on trustedfirmware.org.

If it is a query or a design discussion it is better discussed via the [mailing list](https://lists.trustedfirmware.org/mailman/listinfo/tf-a). If it is issue/bug which need to be tracked, raise an issue in the [issue tracking board](https://developer.trustedfirmware.org/maniphest/query/open/) and also send an email to the [mailing list](https://lists.trustedfirmware.org/mailman/listinfo/tf-a) to notify the TF-A community.

## How do I raise issues for TF-A?
Please use our new [issue tracking board](https://developer.trustedfirmware.org/maniphest/query/open/). For this you just need to login with your existing GitHub account. We also have a [guide](https://developer.trustedfirmware.org/dashboard/view/6/) to help you raise the issue with the appropriate labels and tags. This way it will be easier for both you and us to track and address the issue most effectively.

We are looking forward to seeing you in trustedfirmware.org!
