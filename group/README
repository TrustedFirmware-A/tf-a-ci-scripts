Subdirectories in this directory map test groups to a set of individual
build/run configs and the parameters. Format is:


+-test_config1
| +-build_config1:run_config1
| |  \- (contents are additional options, if any)
| \-build_config1:run_config1
|    \- (contents are additional options, if any)
+-test_config2
| ...


Files in this directory map build configs to their run configs. BUILD_CONFIG and
RUN_CONFIG environment variables are set accordingly.

Options inside build/run config files are in the Java property file format: VAR=value;
so, no quoting the RHS.
