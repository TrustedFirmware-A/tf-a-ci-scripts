Subdirectories in this directory map test groups to a set of individual
build/run configs and the parameters. Format is:


+-test_config1
| +-build_config1:run_config1
| |  \- (contents are additional options, if any)
| \-build_config1:run_config1
|    \- (contents are additional options, if any)
+-test_config2
| ...


Files in this directory map build configs to their run configs. BUILD_CONFIG and
RUN_CONFIG environment variables are set accordingly.

Options inside build/run config files are in the Java property file format: VAR=value;
so, no quoting the RHS.

If a build/run config file has ".inactive" suffix, corresponding config will
be skipped (not even built). This can be used as an alternative to complete
deletion of the file if the config has known issues with compilation or testing,
to avoid failing entire CI jobs while those issues are addressed.
